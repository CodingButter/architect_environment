title: Getting Started
description: Getting started with Architect is straightforward.
---

Below is a basic example that demonstrates
how to create and run your first agent:

```bash
# Initialize a new project
npx architect init my-first-project

# Create a simple agent
architect create agent GreetingAgent --template basic

# Run the project
cd my-first-project && npm start
```

This will create a minimal system with a single agent that logs a greeting message to the
console.

### System Architecture

Below is a high-level overview of how the different components of Architect interact with each
other:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Developer
agent "Agent 1" as A1
agent "Agent 2" as A2
component Orchestrator
database ExternalService
queue MessageQueue

Developer --> A1: Develops and deploys agent
Orchestrator --> A1: Manages lifecycle
A1 --> A2: Communicates directly (optional)
A1 --> ExternalService: Integrates via plugin
ExternalService <---> MessageQueue : Exchanges messages
Orchestrator --> MessageQueue: Monitors and routes messages
