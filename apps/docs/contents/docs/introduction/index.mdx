description: A Modular Framework for Agent-Oriented Systems
---

Architect is a scalable, modular framework designed to simplify the development of agent-oriented systems. By leveraging
modern software principles such as microservices, event-driven workflows, and plugin-based extensibility, Architect
enables developers to build flexible, maintainable, and high-performance applications.

## What is Architect?

Architect provides an orchestrator for managing agents, a plugin system for extending functionality, and a structured task
management workflow to ensure seamless execution of automated processes. The framework is particularly well-suited for
large-scale, dynamic environments where adaptability and modularity are key.

## Architectural Overview

The following diagram illustrates the high-level architecture of Architect:

title Architect System - Expanded Workflow

package "Frontend" {
    actor User
    component "UI Dashboard" as UIDashboard
}

package "Backend" {
    component "API Gateway" as APIGateway
    component "Task Queue" as TaskQueue
    component "Logging & Monitoring" as Logging
}

package "Core System" {
    component "Orchestrator" as Orchestrator
    component "Agent Registry" as AgentRegistry
    component "Plugin Registry" as PluginRegistry
}

package "Agents" {
    component "Agent A" as AgentA
    component "Agent B" as AgentB
}

package "Plugins" {
    component "Shared Plugin" as SharedPlugin
    component "Agent-Specific Plugin" as AgentPlugin
}

User --> UIDashboard : Submit Task
UIDashboard --> APIGateway : Send Task via REST/WebSocket
APIGateway --> TaskQueue : Queue Task
TaskQueue --> Orchestrator : Dispatch Task
Orchestrator --> AgentRegistry : Look Up Available Agents
Orchestrator --> AgentA : Assign Task

AgentA --> SharedPlugin : Call Shared Plugin
SharedPlugin --> AgentA : Return Results

AgentA --> AgentPlugin : Call Agent-Specific Plugin
AgentPlugin --> AgentA : Return Customized Results

AgentA --> AgentB : Collaborate on Task
AgentB --> Orchestrator : Return Partial Results
AgentA --> Orchestrator : Return Final Results

Orchestrator --> Logging : Log Task Completion

This diagram shows the flow of tasks through the system, from user submission to task completion and logging.

## Key Features of Architect

### Core Functionality

- **Agent Management**: Scalable orchestration of agents for distributed task execution.
- **Plugin System**: Extensible architecture for adding custom functionality.
- **Task Queue**: Reliable task distribution and management.
- **Logging & Monitoring**: Comprehensive system observability.

### Design Principles

- **Modularity**: Components are loosely coupled for flexibility and maintainability.
- **Extensibility**: Easily add new agents, plugins, or integrations.
- **Performance**: Optimized for high-throughput and low-latency environments.
- **Resilience**: Built-in fault tolerance and error handling.

## Why Architect?

### Flexibility and Customization

Architect is designed to adapt to a wide range of use cases. Whether you're building a distributed workflow engine, an IoT
platform, or a microservices ecosystem, Architect provides the foundation for your system.

### Use Cases

- **Distributed Task Execution**: Run tasks across multiple agents in parallel.
- **Event-Driven Systems**: Process events in real-time with configurable handlers.
- **Custom Workflows**: Define complex workflows using a visual or code-based interface.
- **Integration Hub**: Connect disparate systems using plugins and adapters.

### Developer Benefits

- **Simplified Complexity**: Abstract away low-level details and focus on business logic.
- **Rapid Development**: Leverage pre-built components and tools to accelerate development.
- **Community Support**: Join an active community of developers and contributors.

## Getting Started

Here’s a quick guide to getting started with Architect:

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (or your preferred runtime environment)
- Docker (optional but recommended for containerized deployments)

### Installation

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install @architect/core

# Initialize a new project
npx architect init my-project
```

### Basic Usage

```javascript
const { Architect } = require("@architect/core")

// Create a new instance of Architect
const architect = new Architect()

// Register an agent
architect.registerAgent({
  name: "example-agent",
  task: async () => {
    console.log("Task executed!")
    return { status: "success" }
  },
})

// Start the system
architect.start()
```

### Running in Production

```bash
# Build and start the application
npm run build && npm run start

# Or use Docker
docker-compose up -d
```
