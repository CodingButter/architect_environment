title: Core Concepts
description: Before diving deeper into the framework, it's essential to understand the core concepts that make up the Architect ecosystem.

#### Agents

Agents are the fundamental execution units within Architect. They represent discrete components
of your system that can operate independently or collaboratively to achieve a common goal. Each
agent is designed to perform a specific task and can communicate with other agents through
well-defined interfaces.

##### Characteristics of Agents:

- **Autonomous**: Agents operate independently, making decisions based on their current state
  and the information they receive from other components.
- **Specialized**: Each agent is designed for a specific purpose, ensuring that your system
  remains modular and easy to maintain.
- **Communicative**: Agents can exchange information with each other directly or through
  centralized coordination mechanisms.

#### Plugins

Plugins are extensions that allow you to enhance the functionality of your agents. They provide
a way to integrate external services, add new behaviors, or modify existing ones without
altering the core framework. Plugins are designed to be lightweight and easy to develop, making
it simple for developers to extend the capabilities of their system.

##### Types of Plugins:

- **Service Integration**: Connect your agents to external services such as databases, messaging
  queues, or cloud platforms.
- **Behavior Modification**: Extend or override default behaviors of agents to customize their
  operation.
- **Utility Functions**: Add helper functions that can be used across multiple agents to reduce
  code duplication.

#### Orchestrator

The orchestrator is the central component responsible for managing the lifecycle of your agents
and ensuring that they operate in harmony. It handles tasks such as agent creation,
communication, and resource allocation. The orchestrator also monitors the system's health and
takes corrective actions when necessary.

##### Key Responsibilities:

- **Agent Lifecycle Management**: Create, start, stop, and terminate agents as needed.
- **Communication Brokerage**: Facilitate communication between agents, ensuring that they can
  exchange information efficiently.
- **Resource Allocation**: Manage resources such as CPU, memory, and network bandwidth to ensure
  optimal performance.
- **Health Monitoring**: Continuously monitor the system's health and take proactive measures to
  prevent failures.

#### Workflow

The workflow defines the sequence of actions that your system will execute. It specifies how
agents interact with each other, what triggers their execution, and how data flows through the
system. Workflows can be defined using a declarative syntax or through a visual interface,
making it easy to design complex processes without writing extensive code.

##### Key Aspects:

- **Definition**: Define workflows using a simple, human-readable format.
- **Execution**: The orchestrator interprets and executes workflows, ensuring that agents are
  activated in the correct order.
- **Monitoring**: Track the progress of workflows in real-time and receive notifications when
  specific events occur.
