## Step 1: Installation

Architect can be set up in just a few steps. Ensure you have the prerequisites installed:

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: Version 16.x or higher
- **npm** or **yarn**: For package management
- **Git**: To clone the repository

### Install Architect CLI

```bash
npx create-architect <project-directory>
```

This command will initialize a new Architect project in the specified directory.
Alternatively, clone the repository manually:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/codingbutter/architect_environment.git
cd architect_environment
npm install
```

---

## Step 2: Configuration

Architect uses a configuration file to define agents, plugins, and tools. The default configuration file is `architect.config.json`.

### Example Configuration File

```json
{
  "projectName": "My First Architect Project",
  "agents": [
    {
      "name": "data-analyzer",
      "description": "Analyzes datasets and provides insights.",
      "tools": ["data-cleaning", "data-visualization"],
      "plugins": {
        "shared": ["data-fetch-plugin"],
        "specific": []
      }
    }
  ],
  "plugins": ["data-cleaning", "data-visualization", "data-fetch-plugin"]
}
```

- **`projectName`**: The name of your project.
- **`agents`**: A list of agents with their configurations.
- **`plugins`**: A global list of plugins available to all agents.

---

## Step 3: Creating Your First Agent

Agents are the core of Architect. To create an agent, define it in the configuration file and provide the necessary tools and plugins.

### Adding an Agent

Update the `architect.config.json` file:

```json
{
  "agents": [
    {
      "name": "text-summary-agent",
      "description": "Summarizes large texts efficiently.",
      "tools": ["nlp-summarizer", "keyword-extractor"],
      "plugins": {
        "shared": ["nlp-plugin"],
        "specific": []
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

Run Architect to apply the changes:

```bash
npm run architect:start
```

---

## Step 4: Using Plugins

Plugins extend the functionality of agents. They can be shared across agents or tailored to specific needs.

### Example: Adding a New Plugin

1. Install the plugin:
   ```bash
   npm install architect-plugin-nlp
   ```
2. Update the configuration:
   ```json
   {
     "plugins": ["architect-plugin-nlp"]
   }
   ```
3. Use the plugin in your agent:
   ```json
   {
     "agents": [
       {
         "name": "text-summary-agent",
         "plugins": {
           "shared": ["architect-plugin-nlp"]
         }
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

---

## Step 5: Running Your Project

Start Architect with the following command:

```bash
npm run start
```

This will initialize the orchestrator, load your agents, and activate the plugins.
Access the Architect dashboard at `http://localhost:3000` for a graphical interface to manage agents and workflows.

---

## Step 6: Exploring Advanced Features

### Self-Updating Documentation

Architect dynamically updates its documentation based on changes to the configuration and codebase. View the latest docs in the `docs` directory.

### Git Integration

Architect integrates seamlessly with Git to track changes and manage documentation updates. Ensure your repository is configured with:

```bash
git init
git remote add origin <repository-url>
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Missing Dependencies**:
   - Run `npm install` to ensure all dependencies are installed.
2. **Agent Not Loading**:
   - Verify the configuration file syntax.
   - Check for plugin compatibility.
3. **Port Already in Use**:
   - Stop other processes using the same port or change the port in the `architect.config.json` file.
