Architect is built around several core components that interact to provide a scalable and modular framework. Below is an overview of these components:

## Orchestrator

The orchestrator acts as the central hub for managing tasks and agent interactions.

```plantuml
@startuml
title Orchestrator
participant TaskQueue
participant AgentManager
participant Logger

TaskQueue --> AgentManager : Assign Task
AgentManager -> Logger : Log Assignment
AgentManager --> Agent : Dispatch Task
Agent -> Logger : Log Completion
@enduml
```

The orchestrator ensures task routing, error handling, and logging are handled effectively.
