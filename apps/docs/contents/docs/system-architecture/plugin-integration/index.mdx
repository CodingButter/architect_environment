description: Integrating plugins into the Architect system.
---

Plugins in Architect extend the functionality of agents and provide reusable logic for various tasks. They can be shared across agents or customized for specific needs.

## Plugin Architecture

```plantuml
@startuml
title Plugin Integration
package "Plugins" {
  component "Shared Plugin" as SharedPlugin
  component "Agent-Specific Plugin" as AgentPlugin
}
package "Agents" {
  component "Agent A" as AgentA
  component "Agent B" as AgentB
}
AgentA --> SharedPlugin : Use Plugin
AgentB --> AgentPlugin : Customize Plugin
@enduml
```

### Shared Plugins

Shared plugins are reusable across multiple agents and provide generic functionality, such as data transformation or logging.

### Agent-Specific Plugins

Agent-specific plugins are tailored to the requirements of individual agents, enabling specialized behavior and integration.

By leveraging plugins, Architect ensures modularity and reduces code duplication.
