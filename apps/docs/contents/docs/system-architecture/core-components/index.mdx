Architect is built around several key components to provide a robust and scalable architecture:

## Orchestrator

The orchestrator acts as the central hub for managing tasks and agent interactions.

```plantuml
@startuml
title Orchestrator
participant TaskQueue
participant AgentManager
participant Logger

TaskQueue --> AgentManager : Assign Task
AgentManager -> Logger : Log Assignment
AgentManager --> Agent : Dispatch Task
Agent -> Logger : Log Completion
@enduml
```

## Agents

Agents are modular, task-specific entities designed to handle logic independently.

```plantuml
@startuml
title Agents
participant Orchestrator
participant Agent
participant Plugin

Orchestrator --> Agent : Send Context
Agent -> Plugin : Use Plugin
Plugin --> Agent : Return Result
Agent --> Orchestrator : Return Processed Data
@enduml
```

## Plugins

Plugins extend the capabilities of agents by providing reusable logic and integration with external systems.

```plantuml
@startuml
title Plugins
package "Plugins" {
  component "Shared Plugin" as SharedPlugin
  component "Agent-Specific Plugin" as AgentPlugin
}
package "Agents" {
  component "Agent A" as AgentA
  component "Agent B" as AgentB
}
AgentA --> SharedPlugin : Use Plugin
AgentB --> AgentPlugin : Customize Plugin
@enduml
```

These components together ensure that Architect remains highly extensible and easy to maintain.
