Alright, I need to help create the "System Architecture" section of the Architect framework's
documentation. The user has specified that there are three subsections: "Orchestrator,"
"Agents," and "Plugins." Each of these needs detailed explanations with PlantUML diagrams and
code examples.

First, I'll start by outlining each subsection based on what was discussed earlier.

**Orchestrator:**

- Definition
- Key Responsibilities (with subpoints)
- Configuration Options (with example YAML)

I should include a diagram showing the Orchestrator's role in managing Agents and Plugins. Then,
provide a code snippet for configuration to make it practical.

**Agents:**

- Characteristics (Autonomous, Specialized, Communicative)
- Lifecycle
- Communication Methods

Here, I'll need diagrams illustrating an Agent's structure and communication methods. A YAML
example for defining an Agent would be helpful.

**Plugins:**

- Types of Plugins (Service Integration, Task Execution, Monitoring/Logging)
- Development Process (with steps)

Including a diagram showing how Plugins interact with Agents will clarify their role. Providing
a code snippet for a custom Plugin will help developers understand implementation.

I also need to ensure that each section is concise and follows the user's header format without
duplicating titles or descriptions since they're already at the top of the page.

### System Architecture Documentation

---

## Orchestrator

The Orchestrator is the central component of the Architect framework, responsible for managing
and coordinating all aspects of your distributed system. It acts as the brain of the operation,
ensuring that agents are functioning correctly, plugins are properly integrated, and overall
system health is maintained.

### Key Responsibilities:

- **Agent Management:** The Orchestrator handles the lifecycle of agents, including deployment,
  execution, monitoring, and termination.
- **Plugin Coordination:** It manages plugin registration, loading, and execution, ensuring
  seamless integration with agents.
- **Resource Allocation:** The Orchestrator optimizes resource usage across the system, ensuring
  efficient performance.
- **Communication Hub:** It facilitates communication between agents, plugins, and external
  services.
- **Error Handling:** The Orchestrator implements fault tolerance mechanisms to handle failures
  gracefully.

### Configuration Options:

The behavior of the Orchestrator can be customized through configuration files. Hereâ€™s an
example:

```yaml
orchestrator:
  agent_management:
    max_retries: 5
    timeout_seconds: 30
  plugin_management:
    auto_load: true
    plugins_dir: "./plugins"
```

### Diagram:

```plantuml
@startuml
component Orchestrator {
  + start()
  + stop()
  + deployAgent(agentId)
  + undeployAgent(agentId)
}
agent "Agent 1" as A1
agent "Agent 2" as A2
plugin "Plugin 1" as P1

Orchestrator --> A1: Deploy and manage
Orchestrator --> A2: Deploy and manage
A1 --> P1: Use plugin functionality
Orchestrator --> P1: Load and register
@enduml
```

## Agents

Agents are the execution units of your system, responsible for carrying out specific tasks. They
operate under the supervision of the Orchestrator and can communicate with each other and
external services.

### Characteristics:

- **Autonomous:** Agents operate independently, executing their tasks as defined.
- **Specialized:** Each agent is designed for a specific function within the system.
- **Communicative:** Agents can exchange information directly or through the Orchestrator.

### Agent Lifecycle:

1. **Deployment:** The agent is registered and initialized by the Orchestrator.
2. **Execution:** The agent performs its tasks based on received instructions or events.
3. **Monitoring:** The agent's status and health are continuously monitored.
4. **Termination:** The agent is gracefully stopped when no longer needed.

### Communication Methods:

- **Direct Communication:** Agents can interact directly with each other using predefined
  interfaces.
- **Orchestrator-mediated Communication:** The Orchestrator acts as an intermediary for message
  passing between agents.

### Configuration Example:

```yaml
agent:
  name: GreetingAgent
  type: basic
  class: com.architect.agents.GreetingAgentImpl
```

### Diagram:

```plantuml
@startuml
class Agent {
  + execute()
  + stop()
}
agent "GreetingAgent" as GA {
  + sayHello(name)
}

GA .> Agent
@enduml
```

## Plugins

Plugins are modular extensions that enhance the functionality of agents. They allow developers
to add new capabilities without modifying the core system.

### Types of Plugins:

- **Service Integration:** Connect with external services (e.g., databases, APIs).
- **Task Execution:** Implement specific tasks or algorithms.
- **Monitoring/Logging:** Provide insights into agent activities and system health.

### Developing a Plugin:

1. **Define Interface:** Create an interface for your plugin to interact with agents.
2. **Implement Logic:** Write the core functionality of your plugin.
3. **Register Plugin:** Configure the Orchestrator to load your plugin.

### Example Plugin Code:

```javascript
// GreeterPlugin.js
class GreeterPlugin {
  constructor(agent) {
    this.agent = agent
  }

  greet(name) {
    return `Hello, ${name}!`
  }
}

module.exports = GreeterPlugin
```

### Diagram:

```plantuml
@startuml
agent "Agent A" as A
plugin "Greeter Plugin" as GP

A --> GP: Uses plugin functionality
GP .> Agent: Extends agent capabilities
@enduml
```

This structured approach ensures clarity and provides developers with a comprehensive
understanding of each component's role within the system architecture.
