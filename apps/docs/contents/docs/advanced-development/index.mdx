This guide covers advanced development techniques for Architect agents, including plugin integration, task chaining, and error handling. By leveraging these features, you can create robust and flexible agents that meet the demands of complex tasks and workflows.

## Plugin Integration

One of the key features of Architect agents is the ability to integrate with plugins. Plugins provide a way to extend the functionality of an agent by adding new tasks, triggers, and other features. By integrating plugins into your agent, you can leverage the existing functionality of the platform and build on top of it to create custom workflows and automation tasks.

To integrate a plugin into your agent, you need to define the plugin in the agent configuration file. This file specifies the name of the plugin and any configuration options that are required. Once the plugin is defined, you can use it in your agent by referencing it in the task configuration.

For example, if you have a plugin that provides a task for sending emails, you can define the plugin in the agent configuration file like this:

```yaml
plugins:
  - name: email-plugin
    config:
      smtp_server: smtp.example.com
      smtp_port: 587
```

Then, you can use the plugin in a task like this:
